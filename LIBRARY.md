app works! i need to do some frontend work which will have to wait for $dayjob

i'll integrate gulp/bower and drop in bootstrap/jquery and html5 boilerplate

might add a filter in the raw data for now, or might use javascript to sort and filter.  the pagination is python so the filtering will probably also be python. pagination may not stay in python because i want to filter in javascript.
