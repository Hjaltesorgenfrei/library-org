### This is an ENHANCEMENT project.

The initial dataset is not complete without getting these barcodes added.

The goodreads API did not have all ISBNs, we will need to use another API for these ISBNs.

This exposes a weakness in the submit form, this touches users so we really want this
to find the result 100% of the time, or else it makes the workflow much more complex, as
books that fail would need manually entered when they have a perfectly good entry on some
other service.


I do not want to do a manual entry form, I would rather enter the info into openlibrary or something
then hit the API once it's accepted. Something that adds to the total knowledge out there.
