###Flask Template Project

This is a subproject with three objectives:

1. Write a dummy sqlalchemy model in sqlite, with option to covert to postgres
2. Write a template with pagination and iteration over a sqlalchemy model
3. Get sqlalchemy model feeding into a template


The project can be used as a template for quick flask webapps.
